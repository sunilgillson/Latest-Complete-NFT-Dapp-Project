As crypto mixes with culture, dapp offerings continue to diversify and mature.
Many visionary projects dissolved into the ether during the long, cold bear market,
yet we can feel their traces in brilliant apps we love and use today. Resilient weeds 
poke out of the proverbial dapp cemetery, calling on their ancestorsâ€™ goals and code bases
to deliver new modes of value exchange and network collaboration. RareArt crawled so Zora could run.
PepeAvatars are reminiscent of the abandoned CryptoPepes. Ujo sowed the seeds for Audius to have 3 million
active users today.</p>
